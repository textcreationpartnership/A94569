            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> of the Common-wealth of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe aſſurance I have, that all your Honours cares and labours have no other aime, then the remooving of all Diſorders, the relieving of the People, and encreaſing more and more the Happineſſe within, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation abroad of this Common-wealth, Hath enboldned me to put your Honours in mind, that the Coyne, when it is ill done, doth cauſe many great diſorders in a State, giving way to the Counterfeiting and Clipping of it, which occaſioneth the death of ſeverall perſons; beſides the tranſporting of the heavieſt pieces out of the Land, to the great hinderance of the Commerce, and the great loſſe and incommodity of the poor people, which is worthy to be taken into conſideration, and to be pitied.</p>
            <p>For the remedy of ſuch a diſorder the Honourable Councell of State had prudently reſolved to have the money well Coyned, if they could but meet with an excellent Workman to have the conduct of that Work: A year ſince I had notice of it, whereupon I ſent hither ſome Paterns of Coyn, which were eſteemed and approoved of by the ſaid Honourable Councell of State, which occaſioned my comming into <hi>England;</hi> where being arrived, I was very curteouſly entertained by the ſaid Honourable Councell, who then doubted not but that Doctor <hi>Gourdon</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Mint,</hi> would be inclinable to a thing ſo much conducing to the good, and relief of the People, but it fell out otherwiſe: For, having applyed my ſelf ſeverall times unto the ſaid Doctor, he told me plainly, That if I was come to be an Officer of the <hi>Mint,</hi> they were already too many, and that the Workmen were more then they had need for the Coyning of their Money, which they would doe ſo well, that the State would-be ſatisfied; And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did promiſe it unto the State.</p>
            <p>A while after, the ſaid Workmen Coyned ſome Money, the ſaid Doctor exhorting them to doe it well, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they uſed their beſt Skill; yet it did coſt dear unto the State, by reaſon of the Stamps they ſpoyled; and was ſo ill favouredly done, that it diſpleaſed both the People, and thoſe that had any skill therein.</p>
            <p>The Honourable Councell of State did ſince give an Order the 3. of <hi>February</hi> laſt, That the Coyne ſhould be better made, and that the Honourable Committee of the <hi>Mint</hi> ſhould hearken unto my Propoſition; which is, by a new Invention of mine, to make a handſomer Coyne, then it can be found in all the world beſides, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſhall not only be Stamped on both Flat-ſides, but ſhall even be marked with Letters upon the thickneſſe of the Brim, whereby the Counterfeiting, Caſting, and Clipping of the Coyne ſhall be prevented. This way is much approoved of, and deſired by all knowing curious, and underſtanding Men, both in the Parliament, and the Honourable Councell of State; and even by moſt men of all ſorts and conditions, who have ſeen my Patterns, and doe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Utility, Profit, and Reputation this Common-wealth will get by it: But the ſaid Doctor, and the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Mint</hi> not willing to underſtand the dammage they cauſe unto the poor People, and to the State alſo; and for their own, and private Intereſt, have ſo croſſed this buſineſſe, that no reſolution hath been yet taken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſo much good unto the State, and the Publick.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Doctor hath told me himſelf in plaine tearms, That he would doe his utmoſt to hinder my Propoſition; and for that end he hath brought in an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lock Smith, one <hi>David Rammage,</hi> a man ill-affected to the preſent Government, who hath been Servant formerly the late deceaſed Maſter <hi>Briot,</hi> for whom he forged his Tools, and marked his Braſſe Counters: which <hi>Rammage</hi> made a proof of a very big Braſſe piece very ill favouredly done, which was marked upon the Thickneſſe of the Brim, after the old way, which is very tedious, and cannot be done upon the Thin ordinary Pieces, as I may doe by my new Invention.</p>
            <p>Further, to hinder that the ſaid Invention of mine ſhould be made uſe of, the ſaid Doctor hath given out, That it was a thing ſo eaſie to be found out, that the Work-men of the <hi>Mint,</hi> and any others could Counterfeit the ſame: And therefore, that it was as good to Coyne the Money of this Common-wealth, as it is Coyned now in <hi>France.</hi> And that he might undertake it, he cauſed the ſaid <hi>Iriſh</hi> Smith to be aſſociated with the Work-men of the <hi>Mint,</hi> ſaying, He would doe it as well, and cheaper than any body elſe: The Money Coyned that way can be Caſt and Clipped. Yet the Honourable Sir <hi>James Harrington</hi> deſiring to know their Price, he did bid them draw a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the loweſt price they would have for, which they did, putting it very low, with no other deſigne, then thereby to diſcourage me, and have me goe away, that afterwards they might fall again to their old way of Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as formerly.</p>
            <p>To know the truth of this thing, whether my Invention is ſo eaſie to be found out, about three moneths ſince an Honourable Member of the Parliament ſent my Proofs to Doctor <hi>Gourdon,</hi> that he might find it out, or cauſe it to be found out by the Work-men of the <hi>Mint,</hi> or any other, and to know what price they would have to Coyn that way: They have ſtill my Proofs, but could not finde out the Invention, nor Caſt them, as the Doctor hath given out that it may be done.</p>
            <p>It is ſo eaſie to know that all ſuch Artifices tend onely to amuſe the State, and make me loſe both my time and patience; but I hope that your Honours, by their prudence and generoſity will prevent it; not ſuffering that the pretended intereſt of ſome private men, be any further hindrance or retardment to the Publick Good, or the Glory that will thereby generally happen to the whole State, but ſpecially to the Honourable Members of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>I ſay, <hi>the pretended intereſt of ſome private men,</hi> becauſe, when I ſhall have inſtructed the Work-men to work after my way, they will have more credit and profit then by any other way of Coyning.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhew the affection and deſire I have to ſerve this Common-wealth, and to live under it, becauſe of the eſteeme I make of the preſent Government, although this way of Coyning I doe propound be more difficult, and chargeable, yet I doe offer to make it for the very ſelf-ſame price, and upon the ſame termes the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Smith and his Aſſociate have demanded to Coyne meerly after the <hi>French</hi> way.</p>
            <p>The ſaid price is five Shillings for Coyning each pound of Gold, and twelve Pence for each pound of Silver.</p>
            <p>The State doth furniſh the Gold and Silver in Plate, with the expences, and maintaining of the Machins, Tooles, Gravers, and all other ſmall Charges neceſſary to make the Money.</p>
            <p>But if the State be willing that I ſhould undertake to maintaine the Machins, Utenſils, and all other ſmall, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, Charges for the perfecting of the Money, it would be more eaſie, and leſſe Chargeable to the State. Yet I will ſubmit to whatſoever your Honours ſhall Command me.</p>
            <p>I moſt humbly beſeech your Honours to take into your ſerious conſideration, that I have been theſe nine Moneths at a great Charge, doing nothing, but ſtill expecting the Honour of your Commands.</p>
            <p>If any man doth call to doubt, or queſtion the poſſibility of what I doe propound, I will make Proof of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Charge to the State.</p>
